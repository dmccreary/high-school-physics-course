## Quality Metrics

### Overall Assessment: 82/100

- **Content Clarity:** 85/100 - Questions are clear, unambiguous, and appropriate for high-school level
- **Educational Value:** 85/100 - Explanations teach concepts and address common misconceptions
- **Technical Accuracy:** 90/100 - Physics principles are correct; some minor Bloom's distribution adjustments needed
- **Format Compliance:** 100/100 - Perfect adherence to mkdocs-material specifications
- **Concept Coverage:** 80/100 - Good coverage with minor gaps in advanced chapters
- **Answer Distribution:** 65/100 - Skewed toward B and C options; ideally would be 25% each
- **Difficulty Progression:** 80/100 - Questions progress appropriately from Remember to higher levels

### Strengths

1. **Consistent Format:** All 90 questions follow exact markdown specifications
2. **Comprehensive Explanations:** Each question includes 40-50 word pedagogical explanations
3. **High Concept Coverage:** Average 80% of chapter concepts tested
4. **Appropriate Difficulty:** Questions align with high-school physics level
5. **Educational Focus:** Questions test understanding, not just memorization
6. **Bloom's Alignment:** Reasonable distribution across cognitive levels
7. **Clear Distractors:** Incorrect options are plausible and test related misconceptions

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Answer Distribution:** Would benefit from more balanced A/B/C/D distribution
   - Current: A=12%, B=54%, C=28%, D=2%
   - Target: A=25%, B=25%, C=25%, D=25%

2. **Advanced Chapters Bloom's Distribution:** Could increase Evaluate and Create level questions
   - Current: Very few Evaluate/Create questions in Ch 10-12
   - Target: 10-15% Evaluate, 5% Create for advanced chapters

3. **Concept Coverage Gaps:**
   - Ch 4: Missing 3 concepts (Friction, Tension, Centripetal Force - covered in Ch 5)
   - Ch 6: Missing 6 concepts (could test more on Elastic PE and Energy Diagrams)
   - Ch 10: Missing 5 concepts (could test more on Interference, Standing Waves)
