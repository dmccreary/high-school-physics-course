| Priority | Count | Percentage of Gaps |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| High (Critical) | 20 | 19% |

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Address Critical Gaps (+20 questions)

Focus on the 20 high-priority concepts listed above. These are foundational, high-centrality concepts that students frequently ask about.

**Estimated Work:**
- Time: 3-4 hours
- New questions: 20
- Expected coverage increase: 47.5% → 57.5%
- Expected quality score increase: 88 → 92

### Phase 2: Selective Medium Priority (+15-20 questions)

Target underrepresented taxonomies:
- Sound: Add 4-5 questions (current 27% → target 50%)
- Oscillations: Add 5-6 questions (current 36% → target 50%)
- Optics: Add 6-8 questions (current 34% → target 45%)

**Estimated Work:**
- Time: 2-3 hours
- New questions: 15-20
- Expected coverage increase: 57.5% → 67.5%
- Expected quality score increase: 92 → 95

### Phase 3: Responsive Additions (Ongoing)

Monitor student questions during course delivery. Add FAQ entries for:
- Frequently asked questions not currently covered
- Common misconceptions that emerge
- Topics students find most challenging

**Approach:** Organic growth based on actual student needs

## Conclusion

The current FAQ covers 47.5% of concepts with strong quality (88/100). Addressing the 20 high-priority gaps would raise coverage to 57.5% and quality to 92/100, providing excellent support for student learning. Medium-priority concepts should be addressed selectively based on taxonomy underrepresentation and student feedback.

Low-priority gaps do not require FAQ coverage as they are adequately addressed in chapter content and glossary. The strategic approach is to focus on high-centrality, frequently-questioned concepts rather than attempting comprehensive coverage of all 200 concepts.
