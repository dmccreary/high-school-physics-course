Students master physics concepts by sequentially building cognitive skills\u2014from recalling fundamental principles to designing original experiments and novel solutions to real-world problems.  This is a hands-on course using equipment in our physics lab as well as the use of extensive online interactive simulations (MicroSims) that keep students engaged.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#why-this-course","title":"Why This Course","text":"<p>Picture this: you\u2019re not just learning about the universe\u2014you\u2019re learning to speak its language. In this physics class, you\u2019ll trade textbooks for trebuchets, memorization for machine-building, and passive note-taking for active world-bending. One day you\u2019re calculating the perfect angle to sink a basketball shot; the next, you\u2019re designing a Rube Goldberg machine that takes three minutes to flick a switch, then defending your design like a TED speaker. You\u2019ll decode the physics behind your favorite video games, demolish movie scenes with real science, and turn lab day into a friendly competition to launch projectiles with laser precision. It\u2019s a place where failure is just data, \u201cEureka!\u201d moments happen weekly, and you\u2019ll walk out seeing hidden mechanics in everything\u2014from your phone\u2019s touchscreen to the way light dances on water. Challenging? Absolutely. But between the collaborative chaos of creation, the thrill of cracking a problem that stumped you yesterday, and the sheer joy of making something move exactly as you predicted, you\u2019ll realize the secret: physics isn\u2019t just the foundation of engineering and technology\u2014it\u2019s one of the most genuinely fun rides high school has to offer.</p> <p>Prerequisites: Algebra II, Geometry

Before we dive into exciting topics like motion, forces, and energy, we need to establish a solid foundation of scientific practices and mathematical tools. Think of this chapter as your physics toolkit: just as a carpenter needs hammers, saws, and measuring tapes before building a house, you need these foundational skills before exploring the physical world.</p> <p>This chapter will equip you with the essential skills every physicist uses: conducting experiments systematically, making precise measurements, working with units and conversions, analyzing errors, and using vectors and graphs to describe physical quantities. These aren't just abstract concepts\u2014they're practical tools you'll use in every lab, every problem set, and every physics investigation throughout this course.</p> <p>The Scientific Method: How Physicists Think</p> <p>Science isn't just a collection of facts\u2014it's a systematic way of asking questions and finding reliable answers about the   natural world. The scientific method is the cornerstone of all scientific investigation, providing a structured approach to   understanding phenomena through observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis.</p> <p>The scientific method typically follows these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Observe a phenomenon or identify a question</li> <li>Research existing knowledge on the topic</li> <li>Formulate a hypothesis (a testable prediction)</li> <li>Design and conduct an experiment to test the hypothesis</li> <li>Analyze the data collected from the experiment</li> <li>Draw conclusions based on the evidence</li> <li>Communicate results to the scientific community</li> <li>Repeat and refine based on feedback and new questions</li> </ol> <p>Let's consider a real-world example. Suppose you notice that when you drop different objects from the same height, some seem to   fall faster than others. You might hypothesize: \"Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.\" To test this, you could   design an experiment dropping objects of different masses from the same height and timing their fall. After collecting data,   you'd analyze whether the results support your hypothesis.</p> <p>Purpose: Visualize the scientific method process with decision points for hypothesis testing</p> <p>Visual style: Flowchart with rounded rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, and directional arrows</p> <p>Steps:   1.

Even when results don't   support our initial hypothesis, we learn valuable information that helps refine our understanding.</p> <p>Measurement: The Language of Physics</p> <p>Physics is a quantitative science, which means we express concepts using numbers and measurements rather than qualitative   descriptions. Saying \"the ball moved fast\" is less useful than saying \"the ball moved at 15 meters per second.\" Measurement is   the process of comparing a physical quantity to a standard unit, allowing us to communicate precise information about the   physical world.</p> <p>Every measurement consists of two parts:</p> <ul> <li>A numerical value (the magnitude)</li> <li>A unit (the standard of comparison)</li> </ul> <p>For example, \"5.2 meters\" tells us both how much (5.2) and what we're measuring (meters). The unit gives meaning to the   number\u20145.2 meters is very different from 5.2 millimeters or 5.2 kilometers!</p> <p>SI Units: The International Standard</p> <p>To ensure scientists worldwide can communicate effectively, the scientific community uses the International System of Units   (abbreviated SI from the French \"Syst\u00e8me International\"). This standardized system is based on seven fundamental base units from    which all other units are derived.</p> <p>The seven SI base units are:</p> Physical Quantity SI Unit Symbol Length meter m Mass kilogram kg Time second s Electric Current ampere A Temperature kelvin K Amount of Substance mole mol Luminous Intensity candela cd <p>For this physics course, we'll primarily work with the first three: length (meters), mass (kilograms), and time (seconds). All   other mechanical units\u2014like velocity, acceleration, force, and energy\u2014are derived units constructed from combinations of these   base units.</p> <p>Derived units are created by mathematically combining base units. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Velocity = distance \u00f7 time, so its unit is meters per second (m/s)</li> <li>Acceleration = velocity change \u00f7 time, so its unit is meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2)</li> <li>Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration, so its unit is kilogram-meters per second squared (kg\u00b7m/s\u00b2), which we call a newton (N)</li> </ul> <p>Metric Prefixes: Handling Different Scales</p> <p>The metric system uses prefixes to express very large or very small quantities conveniently. These prefixes represent powers of   ten and can be attached to any SI unit.</p> Prefix Symbol Power of 10 Example giga- G 10\u2079 gigameter (Gm) = 1,000,000,000 m mega- M 10\u2076 megameter (Mm) = 1,000,000 m kilo- k 10\u00b3 kilometer (km) = 1,000 m base unit - 10\u2070 meter (m) = 1 m centi- c 10\u207b\u00b2 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 m milli- m 10\u207b\u00b3 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 m micro- \u03bc 10\u207b\u2076 micrometer (\u03bcm) = 0.000001 m nano- n 10\u207b\u2079 nanometer (nm) = 0.000000001 m <p>Notice the pattern: each prefix represents a specific power of ten. This makes conversions within the metric system   straightforward compared to other systems (like converting inches to feet to miles).</p> <p>Learning objective: Help students visualize the relative scale of metric prefixes and practice conversions between different   orders of magnitude</p> <p>Canvas layout (800x600px):   - Top area (800x150): Title and instruction text   - Middle area (800x350): Visual scale showing objects at different metric scales   - Bottom area (800x100): Interactive conversion practice area</p> <p>Visual elements:   - Horizontal logarithmic scale from nanometers to kilometers   - Animated objects appearing at appropriate scale points:     - Virus (nanometer scale) - ~100 nm     - Human hair width (micrometer scale) - ~100 \u03bcm     - Fingernail width (millimeter scale) - ~10 mm     - Textbook height (centimeter scale) - ~25 cm     - Person height (meter scale) - ~1.7 m     - Football field (kilometer scale) - ~0.1 km   - Each object labeled with measurement and prefix   - Zoom functionality to focus on specific scale ranges</p> <p>Interactive controls:   - Slider: Select a scale to explore (nano to kilo)   - Button: \"Show Comparison\" - displays two selected objects side by side   - Input field: \"Convert this value\" with dropdown for source unit   - Input field: Target unit selection   - Button: \"Check Answer\" with immediate feedback   - Display: Running score of correct conversions</p> <p>Default parameters:   - Starting scale: meter (10\u2070)   - Initial comparison: Comparing a meter stick to a centimeter   - Conversion practice: Random values between 1-1000</p> <p>Behavior:   - Slider movement smoothly zooms the scale visualization   - Object icons grow/shrink proportionally as zoom changes   - Hovering over objects shows detailed information (actual size, common examples)   - Conversion practice generates random problems (e.g., \"Convert 2.5 km to meters\")   - Correct answers trigger positive feedback animation (green checkmark)   - Incorrect answers show correct answer and explanation</p> <p>Implementation notes:   - Use p5.js for rendering and animation   - Logarithmic scale positioning: position = log\u2081\u2080(size) * scaleFactor   - Store object data in array with {name, size_in_meters, image, description}   - Conversion logic: multiply or divide by appropriate power of 10   - Track statistics: problems attempted, correct answers, average time</p> <p>Implementation: p5.js with custom canvas controls   Unit Conversion: Translating Between Systems</p> <p>While SI units are standard in science, you'll often encounter other measurement systems in daily life\u2014like miles per hour for   speed or pounds for weight. Unit conversion is the process of changing a measurement from one unit to another while preserving   its physical meaning.</p> <p>The key to unit conversion is using conversion factors\u2014fractions equal to 1 that allow you to cancel unwanted units and   introduce desired ones. Since multiplying by 1 doesn't change a quantity's value, we can strategically multiply by conversion   factors to change units.</p> <p>Example: Convert 25 meters to centimeters.</p> <p>We know that 1 m = 100 cm, which gives us two possible conversion factors:   - (100 cm)/(1 m) = 1   - (1 m)/(100 cm) = 1</p> <p>We choose the first one because it allows meters to cancel:</p> <p>25 m \u00d7 (100 cm / 1 m) = 2,500 cm</p> <p>Notice how \"m\" in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving only \"cm.\"</p> <p>Multi-step conversions involve applying multiple conversion factors sequentially. For example, converting miles per hour to   meters per second requires converting both distance and time units:</p> <p>60 mi/hr \u00d7 (1.609 km / 1 mi) \u00d7 (1,000 m / 1 km) \u00d7 (1 hr / 3,600 s) \u2248 26.8 m/s</p> <p>Scientific Notation: Handling Extreme Numbers</p> <p>Physics deals with quantities spanning enormous ranges\u2014from the diameter of an atomic nucleus (about 0.000000000000001 meters)   to the distance to the nearest star (about 40,000,000,000,000,000 meters). Writing and calculating with such numbers becomes   unwieldy using standard decimal notation.</p> <p>Scientific notation expresses numbers as a product of two parts:   - A coefficient between 1 and 10   - A power of 10</p> <p>Format: a \u00d7 10\u207f, where 1 \u2264 a &lt; 10 and n is an integer</p> <p>Examples:   - 5,280 = 5.28 \u00d7 10\u00b3 (move decimal left 3 places, positive exponent)   - 0.00042 = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 (move decimal right 4 places, negative exponent)   - 93,000,000 = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u2077 (move decimal left 7 places)</p> <p>Why use scientific notation?</p> <ol> <li>Clarity: 6.02 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 is much clearer than 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</li> <li>Precision: Scientific notation makes significant figures obvious</li> <li>Calculation: Multiplication and division become easier using exponent rules</li> <li>Range: It handles extremely large and small numbers equally well</li> </ol> <p>Calculation rules:   - Multiplication: Multiply coefficients, add exponents: (2 \u00d7 10\u00b3) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10\u2074) = 6 \u00d7 10\u2077   - Division: Divide coefficients, subtract exponents: (6 \u00d7 10\u2078) \u00f7 (2 \u00d7 10\u00b3) = 3 \u00d7 10\u2075   - Addition/Subtraction: Convert to same exponent first, then add/subtract coefficients</p> <p>Significant Figures: Communicating Precision</p> <p>When you measure something in the lab, your measurement is limited by your instrument's precision. A ruler marked in millimeters    lets you measure more precisely than one marked only in centimeters. Significant figures (or \"sig figs\") are the digits in a   measurement that carry meaningful information about its precision.</p> <p>Rules for counting significant figures:</p> <ol> <li>Non-zero digits are always significant: 245 has 3 sig figs</li> <li>Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 1,005 has 4 sig figs</li> <li>Leading zeros are NOT significant: 0.0052 has 2 sig figs (the 5 and 2)</li> <li>Trailing zeros after a decimal point ARE significant: 2.500 has 4 sig figs</li> <li>Trailing zeros in a whole number are ambiguous unless specified: 1,200 has 2-4 sig figs depending on measurement precision</li> </ol> <p>Why do significant figures matter?</p> <p>They prevent false precision. If you measure a table with a meterstick marked in centimeters and report its length as 1.245738   meters, you're claiming more precision than your instrument can provide. Proper use of significant figures honestly communicates    the uncertainty in your measurement.</p> <p>Calculation rules:</p> <ul> <li>Addition/Subtraction: Round result to the least precise decimal place among the values<ul> <li>Example: 12.3 + 0.45 = 12.75 \u2192 round to 12.8 (tenths place, matching 12.3)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Multiplication/Division: Round result to the fewest significant figures among the values<ul> <li>Example: 4.56 \u00d7 2.1 = 9.576 \u2192 round to 9.6 (2 sig figs, matching 2.1)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Dimensional Analysis: Checking Your Work</p> <p>Have you ever gotten an answer on a physics problem and wondered if it makes sense? Dimensional analysis (also called unit   analysis) is a powerful technique for checking whether equations and calculations are physically reasonable by verifying that   units are consistent.</p> <p>The fundamental principle: valid equations must be dimensionally homogeneous, meaning both sides must have the same units. You   can't have meters on one side and seconds on the other\u2014it's like saying apples equal oranges.</p> <p>Example: Suppose you're verifying a proposed equation for the distance traveled by an accelerating object:</p> <p>d = v \u00d7 t + \u00bda \u00d7 t\u00b2</p> <p>where d = distance, v = initial velocity, a = acceleration, t = time</p> <p>Let's check the dimensions (using brackets [ ] to denote \"dimensions of\"):</p> <ul> <li>[d] = meters (m)</li> <li>[v \u00d7 t] = (m/s) \u00d7 s = m \u2713</li> <li>[\u00bda \u00d7 t\u00b2] = (m/s\u00b2) \u00d7 s\u00b2 = m \u2713</li> </ul> <p>Each term has dimensions of meters, so the equation is dimensionally consistent. This doesn't prove the equation is correct (the    factors of \u00bd and 1 can't be verified this way), but it does confirm we haven't made gross errors like adding velocity to   acceleration.</p> <p>Practical tip: If your calculated answer for a velocity comes out in kg\u00b7m/s instead of m/s, you know something went wrong in   your calculation!</p> <p>Error Analysis: Embracing Uncertainty</p> <p>No measurement is perfect. Every experimental value contains some degree of uncertainty due to limitations of measuring   instruments, environmental conditions, and human observation. Rather than hiding from this reality, physicists embrace it   through error analysis\u2014the systematic study and quantification of measurement uncertainties.</p> <p>Types of errors:</p> <ol> <li>Systematic Errors (Bias)</li> <li>Consistent errors that affect all measurements in the same way</li> <li>Caused by faulty equipment calibration, environmental factors, or flawed experimental design</li> <li>Example: A scale that always reads 0.5 kg too heavy produces systematic error</li> <li>Can be reduced by calibrating equipment and improving experimental design</li> <li> <p>Cannot be reduced by averaging multiple measurements</p> </li> <li> <p>Random Errors (Precision)</p> </li> <li>Unpredictable fluctuations that vary from measurement to measurement</li> <li>Caused by limitations in instrument precision or uncontrolled environmental variations</li> <li>Example: Slight variations in reaction time when using a stopwatch</li> <li>Can be reduced by averaging multiple measurements</li> <li>Result in a spread of values around the true value</li> </ol> <p>Quantifying Uncertainty:</p> <p>When reporting measurements, we express uncertainty explicitly:</p> <p>measured value \u00b1 uncertainty</p> <p>For example: length = 2.45 \u00b1 0.02 meters</p> <p>This means the true value likely falls between 2.43 m and 2.47 m.</p> <p>Common methods for calculating uncertainty:</p> <ul> <li>Absolute uncertainty: The actual magnitude of uncertainty (e.g., \u00b10.02 m)</li> <li>Relative uncertainty: The fractional or percentage uncertainty (e.g., 0.02/2.45 = 0.8%)</li> <li>Standard deviation: A statistical measure of the spread in repeated measurements</li> </ul> <p>Purpose: Visually distinguish between precision (repeatability) and accuracy (correctness) in measurements</p> <p>Components to show:   - Four target boards arranged in a 2\u00d72 grid   - Each target has concentric circles (bullseye in center)   - Each target shows multiple dart impacts as colored dots</p> <p>Target 1 (Top-left): \"High Accuracy, High Precision\"   - Description label: \"Accurate and Precise\"   - 5-6 dart impacts clustered tightly near the bullseye center   - Dots colored green   - Caption: \"Measurements close to true value and tightly grouped\"</p> <p>Target 2 (Top-right): \"High Accuracy, Low Precision\"   - Description label: \"Accurate but Not Precise\"   - 5-6 dart impacts scattered around the bullseye area (within inner ring)   - Dots colored blue   - Caption: \"Measurements average to true value but widely spread\"</p> <p>Target 3 (Bottom-left): \"Low Accuracy, High Precision\"   - Description label: \"Precise but Not Accurate\"   - 5-6 dart impacts clustered tightly in upper-right quadrant (away from center)   - Dots colored orange   - Caption: \"Measurements tightly grouped but offset from true value (systematic error)\"</p> <p>Target 4 (Bottom-right): \"Low Accuracy, Low Precision\"   - Description label: \"Neither Accurate Nor Precise\"   - 5-6 dart impacts scattered randomly across entire target   - Dots colored red   - Caption: \"Measurements scattered and offset from true value\"</p> <p>Additional elements:   - Title centered above: \"Precision vs. Accuracy in Measurements\"   - Bullseye labeled as \"True Value\" on first target   - Legend explaining:     - Accuracy = how close measurements are to true value     - Precision = how close measurements are to each other   - Axis labels: \"PRECISION\" (increasing left to right), \"ACCURACY\" (increasing bottom to top)</p> <p>Visual style: Clean, colorful diagram with clear target circles</p> <p>Color scheme:   - Target backgrounds: light gray   - Bullseye: yellow center, red ring, white outer   - Impact dots: As specified above (green, blue, orange, red)   - Text: Dark gray on white background</p> <p>Implementation: SVG graphic or similar vector format for clarity   Precision vs Accuracy: Two Different Concepts</p> <p>Students often confuse precision and accuracy, but they describe different aspects of measurement quality:</p> <p>Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. An accurate measurement has low systematic error.   Think of it as \"correctness.\"</p> <p>Precision refers to how close multiple measurements are to each other\u2014the repeatability or reproducibility of measurements.   Precise measurements have low random error. Think of it as \"consistency.\"</p> <p>Key insight: A measurement can be precise without being accurate, and vice versa!</p> <p>Consider measuring the speed of light with sophisticated equipment. If your equipment is precisely calibrated but you   consistently get 3.05 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s while the true value is 3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s, you have:   - High precision (measurements consistently near 3.05 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s)   - Low accuracy (measurements far from the true value of 3.00 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s)</p> <p>This situation indicates systematic error\u2014perhaps a calibration problem with your equipment.</p> <p>Goal in physics: Strive for both high accuracy (by eliminating systematic errors) and high precision (by using quality   instruments and careful technique).</p> <p>Scalars and Vectors: Two Types of Quantities</p> <p>Physical quantities in physics fall into two fundamental categories based on what information they require for complete   description:</p> <p>Scalars are quantities fully described by a magnitude (size or amount) alone. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Temperature: 25\u00b0C</li> <li>Mass: 5.2 kg</li> <li>Speed: 30 m/s</li> <li>Energy: 150 joules</li> <li>Time: 12 seconds</li> </ul> <p>Notice that each scalar needs only a number and unit\u2014there's no directional information.</p> <p>Vectors are quantities that require both magnitude and direction for complete description. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Displacement: 50 meters north</li> <li>Velocity: 30 m/s at 45\u00b0 above the horizontal</li> <li>Force: 100 newtons downward</li> <li>Acceleration: 9.8 m/s\u00b2 toward the ground</li> <li>Momentum: 250 kg\u00b7m/s eastward</li> </ul> <p>Why does this distinction matter?</p> <p>Many physics problems involve combining quantities.

You might say, \"I walked 2 kilometers,\" which tells someone how far you traveled. Or you might say, \"School is 1.5 kilometers northeast of my house,\" which tells both how far and in what direction. These two descriptions represent fundamentally different concepts: distance and displacement.</p> <p>Distance is the total length of the path traveled, regardless of direction. It's a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude (size) but no direction. If you walk around a 400-meter track and return to where you started, you've traveled a distance of 400 meters even though you end up at your starting point.</p> <p>Displacement, on the other hand, is a vector quantity that describes the straight-line distance and direction from your starting position to your ending position. Using the track example, if you complete one lap, your displacement is zero\u2014you haven't moved from your starting point, even though you traveled 400 meters.</p> <p>Here's a comparison of these two concepts:</p> Property Distance Displacement Type Scalar (magnitude only) Vector (magnitude and direction) Symbol d \u0394x (or \u0394s) Units meters (m) meters (m) Path dependent?

Just as we have two ways to describe position change, we have two ways to describe how quickly that change happens: speed and velocity.</p> <p>Speed tells us how fast an object is moving but doesn't specify direction. It's the rate at which distance is covered over time. When your car's speedometer reads 60 km/h, that's speed\u2014it doesn't tell you whether you're going north, south, or in circles.</p> <p>Average speed is calculated as:</p> <p>Average speed = Total distance / Total time</p> <p>Velocity, like displacement, includes direction.

Conceptually, it's the average velocity over an infinitesimally small time interval. Mathematically, if you've taken calculus, instantaneous velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time: v = dx/dt.</p> <p>For those without calculus background, think of it this way: to find instantaneous velocity at time t, calculate the average velocity over a very small time interval centered on t. The smaller the time interval, the closer you get to the true instantaneous velocity. It's like taking a snapshot of motion\u2014freezing time and asking \"how fast and in what direction right now?\"</p> <p>On a position-time graph (which we'll explore in detail later), the instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.

Let me edit the csv-to-json.py file to add our physics taxonomy names:</p> <p>\u23fa Update(csv-to-json.py)   \u23bf \u00a0Updated csv-to-json.py with 14 additions and 2 removals                                     56        # Supports both text codes (FOUND, DEF, etc.) and numeric IDs (1, 2, etc.)        57        # These are the display names (classifierName in schema) for each taxonomy        58        taxonomy_names = {        59 -          # Text codes        60 -          'FOUND': 'Foundation Concepts',        59 +          # Physics course taxonomy        60 +          'FOUND': 'Foundation',        61 +          'KINEM': 'Kinematics',        62 +          'DYNAM': 'Dynamics',        63 +          'ENRGY': 'Energy',        64 +          'MOMNT': 'Momentum',        65 +          'ROTAT': 'Rotation',        66 +          'OSCIL': 'Oscillations',        67 +          'WAVES': 'Waves',        68 +          'SOUND': 'Sound',        69 +          'LIGHT': 'Light',        70 +          'OPTIC': 'Optics',        71 +          'ELECT': 'Electricity',        72 +          # Generic text codes (fallback)        73            'DEF': 'Definitions',        74            'CORE': 'Core Concepts',        75            'INTER': 'Intermediate',</p> <p>\u23fa Now let me run the csv-to-json.py script with the correct arguments:</p> <p>\u23fa Bash(python csv-to-json.py learning-graph.csv learning-graph.json color-config.json metadata.json)   \u23bf \u00a0\ud83d\udccb Loaded color config from: color-config.json      \ud83d\udccb Loaded metadata from: metadata.json      \u2705 JSON graph created: learning-graph.json      \u2026 +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect! Now let me verify the JSON was created properly and then move on to the taxonomy distribution report:</p> <p>\u23fa Bash(cp /Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/taxonomy-distribution.py       /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/high-school-physics-course/docs/learning-\u2026)   \u23bf \u00a0\u2705 Taxonomy distribution report generated: taxonomy-distribution.md </p> <p>\u23fa Read(taxonomy-distribution.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Read 315 lines</p> <p>\u23fa Excellent! The taxonomy distribution shows great balance. Now I need to create the index.md file for the learning graph section.    Let me check if there's an index-template.md in the skill directory:</p> <p>\u23fa Bash(ls /Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/*.md)   \u23bf \u00a0/Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/index-template.md             /Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/README.md      /Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/SKILL.md      /Users/danmccreary/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/vis-network-json-format.md</p> <p>\u23fa Read(~/.claude/skills/learning-graph-generator/index-template.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Read 93 lines</p> <p>\u23fa Write(index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 85 lines to index.md                                                                                          # Learning Graph for High School Physics Course      This section contains the learning graph for this textbook. A learning graph is      a graph of concepts used in this textbook. Each concept is represented by a      node in a network graph. Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate      what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.      A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning paths.      A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.      \u2026 +75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect!

A learning graph is      a graph of concepts used in this textbook. Each concept is represented by a      node in a network graph. Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate      what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.      A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning paths.      A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.      \u2026 +75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect!

You'll learn the scientific method for conducting      experiments and analyzing data, master the measurement systems and unit conversions critical for quantitative analysis, and      develop proficiency with mathematical tools including vectors, trigonometry, and graphical analysis. These foundational      skills form the basis for understanding all subsequent physics concepts and enable you to approach problems systematically      and quantitatively. By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to perform accurate measurements, analyze experimental errors,       work confidently with vector quantities, and interpret scientific graphs.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 19 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 32 lines to docs/chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md                                                                # Motion in One Dimension      ## Summary      This chapter introduces kinematics, the study of motion without considering its causes. You'll learn to describe and analyze      motion in one dimension using position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Through position-time, velocity-time, and      acceleration-time graphs, you'll develop visual and analytical skills for understanding motion patterns. The kinematic      equations you master here will enable you to solve complex motion problems involving both uniform motion and uniformly      accelerated motion, providing the foundation for understanding all types of mechanical motion in physics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 28 lines to docs/chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md                                                               # Motion in Two Dimensions      ## Summary      This chapter extends your understanding of motion from one dimension to two dimensions, where motion occurs in a plane.      You'll apply vector decomposition and trigonometry to analyze projectile motion, from horizontally launched objects to angled       trajectories like those of kicked soccer balls or launched rockets. Free fall is examined as a special case of accelerated      motion, and you'll explore how observers in different reference frames perceive relative velocities. These skills are      essential for understanding real-world motion, which rarely occurs along a single straight line.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 6 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +18 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 35 lines to docs/chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md                                                                 # Forces and Newton's Laws      ## Summary      This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of dynamics by exploring the relationship between forces and motion.      You'll learn Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, which form the cornerstone of classical mechanics. Starting with the      concept of force as a vector quantity, you'll discover how net force determines acceleration, why objects resist changes in      motion through inertia, and how action-reaction pairs arise in all interactions. The concepts of equilibrium\u2014both static and      dynamic\u2014will help you understand when objects remain at rest or move with constant velocity despite experiencing multiple      forces.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 13 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 34 lines to docs/chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md                                                           # Applications of Newton's Laws      ## Summary      This chapter applies Newton's laws to a variety of real-world scenarios, developing your problem-solving skills through      increasingly complex situations. You'll analyze friction forces that oppose motion, solve problems involving tension in ropes       and cables, and master inclined plane problems using force decomposition. Pulley systems including the Atwood machine      provide opportunities to practice applying Newton's second law to connected objects. Finally, you'll explore circular motion      and learn why centripetal force and centripetal acceleration are necessary to maintain curved paths, including the physics of       banked curves on highways and racetracks.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 38 lines to docs/chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md                                                                   # Work, Energy, and Power      ## Summary      This chapter introduces one of physics' most powerful concepts: energy and its conservation. You'll learn how forces do work      to transfer energy, and how energy transforms between kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy).       The work-energy theorem provides an alternative approach to solving mechanics problems, often simpler than using Newton's      laws directly. You'll distinguish between conservative and non-conservative forces, analyze energy transformations using      diagrams, and explore power as the rate of energy transfer. Simple machines demonstrate how mechanical advantage can amplify      forces, though energy conservation always applies. These energy principles will reappear throughout the rest of physics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:</p> <pre><code> \u2026 +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n</code></pre> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 34 lines to docs/chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md                                                                 # Momentum and Collisions      ## Summary      This chapter introduces momentum, a vector quantity that describes the \"quantity of motion\" an object possesses. You'll      discover how impulse (force applied over time) changes momentum, and learn one of physics' most important principles:      conservation of momentum in isolated systems. This conservation law enables you to analyze collisions\u2014elastic collisions      where kinetic energy is conserved, and inelastic collisions where it is not. You'll solve collision problems in both one and      two dimensions, understand how the center of mass moves for systems of objects, and explore rocket propulsion as a dramatic      application of momentum conservation through Newton's third law.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 35 lines to docs/chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md                                                                   # Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum      ## Summary      This chapter extends the concepts of linear mechanics to rotational motion, revealing beautiful parallels between      translational and rotational quantities. Angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration describe rotational kinematics,      while torque (the rotational analog of force) causes angular acceleration. You'll discover that an object's resistance to      rotational acceleration depends on its rotational inertia, which varies with mass distribution. Rotational kinetic energy and       angular momentum complete the rotational analogs of linear mechanics. The conservation of angular momentum explains      phenomena from spinning figure skaters to orbiting planets, and rolling motion combines both translational and rotational      motion in a single framework.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/09-oscillations/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 39 lines to docs/chapters/09-oscillations/index.md                                                                        # Oscillations and Periodic Motion      ## Summary      This chapter explores periodic motion, where objects repeat the same motion pattern over time. Simple harmonic motion (SHM)      is the most fundamental type of oscillation, characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement. You'll analyze      SHM using amplitude, period, frequency, and angular frequency, and study two classic oscillating systems: springs obeying      Hooke's Law and pendulums swinging under gravity. Real oscillations experience damping due to non-conservative forces like      friction and air resistance. When external forces drive oscillations at specific frequencies, resonance can occur with      dramatic effects\u2014from shattering wine glasses to destroying bridges. These principles apply throughout physics and      engineering.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 55 lines to docs/chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md                                                                         # Waves and Sound      ## Summary      This chapter explores mechanical waves\u2014disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy without transferring       matter. You'll distinguish between transverse waves (where particles oscillate perpendicular to wave motion) and      longitudinal waves (where particles oscillate parallel to wave motion), and characterize waves using wavelength, frequency,      period, and wave speed. Wave interference creates constructive and destructive patterns explained by the superposition      principle, and reflection leads to standing waves with nodes and antinodes. Waves also exhibit refraction (bending when      changing media) and diffraction (spreading around obstacles). The Doppler effect describes frequency shifts for moving      sources or observers. Sound waves exemplify all these principles, with additional properties including intensity measured in      decibels, pitch related to frequency, and phenomena like beats, harmonics, and acoustic resonance that shape the music and      sounds around us.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 30 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +45 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/11-light-optics/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 58 lines to docs/chapters/11-light-optics/index.md                                                                        # Light and Optics      ## Summary      This chapter explores light as an electromagnetic wave and examines how it interacts with matter. You'll study the      electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays, focusing on the visible spectrum humans can perceive. Light's      reflection follows precise laws that govern mirrors\u2014from simple plane mirrors to curved spherical mirrors (concave and      convex) analyzed using mirror equations and ray diagrams. Refraction occurs when light changes media, described by Snell's      Law and the index of refraction, and leads to total internal reflection at critical angles. Lenses (convex and concave)      refract light to form real and virtual images, analyzed using lens equations, thin lens formulas, and ray diagrams with focal       lengths. Dispersion separates white light into colors through prisms, explaining rainbows and related phenomena. Color      addition and subtraction describe how we perceive color. Light also exhibits wave properties through optical diffraction in      Young's double slit experiment, single slit diffraction, and diffraction gratings. Finally, polarization demonstrates light's       transverse wave nature. This comprehensive treatment reveals light's dual nature and practical applications in optics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 41 concepts from the learning graph:</p> <pre><code> \u2026 +48 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n</code></pre> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 43 lines to docs/chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md                                                              # Electric Charge and Electric Fields      ## Summary      This chapter introduces electrostatics, the study of electric charges at rest and the forces they exert. You'll discover that       charge comes in two types\u2014positive and negative\u2014and is conserved in all processes. Materials are classified as conductors,      insulators, semiconductors, or superconductors based on how easily charge flows through them. Charge can be transferred      through friction, contact, or induction, and grounding provides a path for excess charge to dissipate. Coulomb's Law      quantifies the electric force between charges, analogous to Newton's law of gravitation. This force can be visualized using      the electric field concept, represented by electric field lines and characterized by field strength. Moving charges in      electric fields involves electric potential energy, which leads to the concepts of electric potential and voltage\u2014the energy      per unit charge. These foundational concepts in electricity underlie all electronic technology and prepare you for deeper      study of circuits and electromagnetism.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +33 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Now let me update the mkdocs.yml navigation to include the chapters:</p> <p>\u23fa Read(mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Read 70 lines</p> <p>\u23fa Update(mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Updated mkdocs.yml with 14 additions                                                                          9    nav:        10      - Home: index.md        11      - Course Description: course-description.md        12 +    - Chapters:        13 +      - Overview: chapters/index.md        14 +      - Chapter 1 - Scientific Foundations: chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md        15 +      - Chapter 2 - Motion in One Dimension: chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md        16 +      - Chapter 3 - Motion in Two Dimensions: chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md        17 +      - Chapter 4 - Forces and Newton's Laws: chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md        18 +      - Chapter 5 - Applications of Newton's Laws: chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md        19 +      - Chapter 6 - Work, Energy, and Power: chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md        20 +      - Chapter 7 - Momentum and Collisions: chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md        21 +      - Chapter 8 - Rotational Motion: chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md        22 +      - Chapter 9 - Oscillations: chapters/09-oscillations/index.md        23 +      - Chapter 10 - Waves and Sound: chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md        24 +      - Chapter 11 - Light and Optics: chapters/11-light-optics/index.md        25 +      - Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Fields: chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md        26      - Learning Graph:        27        - Introduction: learning-graph/index.md        28        - Concept List: learning-graph/concept-list.md</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect!

I'm ready to help you create a Mermaid workflow diagram.    To generate a diagram, I need to know:    1. What process or workflow do you want to visualize? (e.g., scientific method, problem-solving process, physics experiment   workflow)   2. What are the main steps? (at least 3-5 steps)   3. Are there any decision points or branching paths?   4. Which chapter should I add the iframe reference to? (You mentioned chapter 1 - what's the file path? Likely   docs/chapters/01/index.md or similar?)    Please provide the text/content you want me to convert into a Mermaid diagram, and I'll:   - Create the interactive diagram in /docs/sims/[diagram-name]/   - Generate all necessary files (main.html, index.md, style.css, script.js, metadata.json)   - Add an iframe reference wrapped in &lt;details markdown=\"1\"&gt; tags to chapter 1    What workflow would you like me to diagram?  &gt; &lt;details markdown=\"1\"&gt; Scientific Method Flowchart Type: workflow  Purpose: Visualize the scientific method process with decision points for hypothesis testing  Visual style: Flowchart with rounded rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, and directional arrows  Steps: 1.
